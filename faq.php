	         Get Listed as a Musician with Audio Link?</b><br>
	         To list with Audio Link as a musician, you will need to determine which
	         type of membership is appropriate for your purposes. A basic membership
	         is $9.95 per month It involves access to the Audio Link with thousands
	         of available current agencies and representatives. You may have chances
	         to be chosen to take part in some concert events<br>
	         <br>
	         <b>2. What advantage do I get by listing with Audio Link?</b><br>
	         The first and most obvious advantage is <b>exposure</b>. As a talent
	         musician, you are a product. Any product must be marketed if it is to
	         ever be successful as a product. Some of you have potentials but how
	         many people are seeing them. Some of you have lonely isolated web pages
	         - like uncharted islands in the ocean far away from the busy shipping
	         lanes where you need to be. Audio Link is an active site with solid
	         traffic from members of the talent industry - agents, recording
	         companies, musicians, casting directors, etc. You can be seen here. <br>
	         &nbsp;<br>
	         <b>3. What is the best way to get into professional musicians?</b><br>
	         There is no single sure-fire way to enter the musical arena. Typically,
	         the musician possesses conditions required by agents. The musician
	         needs to indicate through our website that they truly have skills,
	         music and that they are versatile enough to perform in different market
	         categories. <br>
	         <br>
	         <b>4 Do I have other chances to be exposed to public?<br>
	         </b>Audio Link now has established a relationship with some recording
	         companies that have an active events that provide some auditions for
	         new musicians. Once you are our member, Audio Link will recommend you
	         to some recording companies and offer you more opportunities to display
	         your skills.&nbsp; <br>
	         &nbsp;<br>
	         <b>5. I have limited musical experience. How can I get attention from
	         the talent agencies?</b><br>
	         It depends upon the genre in which you are interested - and also the
	         part of the country or the world in which you are living. First, no
	         matter who you are, whether you are profession or amateur. You must
	         register your profile and promote yourself.&nbsp; </font></p>
	         <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>6. How can I
	         avoid be ripped off by bad agents?</b><br>
	         The answer to this is simple. In the early stages, never sign an
	         exclusive with an agent. Allow yourself to be handled by a number of
	         different agents and then learn who believes in you enough, and is
	         ethical enough to get you the right auditions. One absolute rule: if an
	         agent tries to charge you any fees whatsoever, or tries to involve you
	         with their training when you just first meeting, run from them! </font>
